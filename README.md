## Getting Started with GitHub

GitHub enables you to host and share website files online, similar to the way Dropbox or Google Drive let you store and share other types of files. GitHub hosts the files in a remote server in the cloud and gives you a working URL so that you can share your finished site with other people.
Let’s walk through this process:

### Step 1: Create a GitHub account
To start, let’s head over to GitHub.com. The first thing we’ll do is create a username by clicking on the field at the top right of the screen.

The username you enter here will be part of the github URL for every site you host there, so choose something simple and easy to remember. Most people use their name, a pen name, or their company's name. To simplify things, try making your username one word and all lowercase.

For this guide, we're going to use the name `gasamplepage.` Please pick whatever name you like, for example `johnsmith123.` After selecting our username, we'll add our email and make up a password. Then we'll click `Sign up for GitHub.`

Clicking that button brings us to the following page:



All we need to do on this page is make sure that "Free" is chosen as our personal plan. It should be pre­selected; however, if it’s not, make sure to click on it. Then, press the “Finish Sign Up” button.
***GitHub will send you an email asking you to verify your account. Take a moment to do this now. I​f you do not verify your email address, your page will not work.​***

### Step 2: Download the GitHub App
Now that we’ve finished creating a GitHub account, we’ll need to download the GitHub app. We’re using a Mac, so we’ll go to m​ac.github.com.​ If you’re using a PC, go to windows.github.com.


From here, click on Download GitHub. Once it’s finished downloading, drag it into your Applications folder. Then, we’ll open our new GitHub app.

### Step 3: Logging into the GitHub App
Let’s login to the app with our new GitHub account. If this is the first time you’ve had GitHub on your computer, a login screen will automatically pop up. You’ll log in and click `continue.` Two additional pages will pop up, but you can ignore them for now. Just click “continue” again, then click `done.`

If the computer you're using has had GitHub before, you'll have to manually log in. Just click on the “GitHub” tab, then click on `Preferences.` Click on `Accounts,` then log in.

Before we can do anything in the GitHub app, we'll first need to go back to github.com and create a new folder to house all our files.


### Step 4: Creating a New Repository
In GitHub, the public folder in the cloud where you can store, update, and share all the files that make up your website is called a “repository”. In order to create a “repo” (as the cool kids say), click on this green button that says “New Repository.”
